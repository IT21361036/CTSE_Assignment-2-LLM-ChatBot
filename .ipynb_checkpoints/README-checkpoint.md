# CTSE Lecture Notes Chatbot

## Objective
Develop a simple chatbot using an LLM to answer questions based on CTSE lecture notes. The chatbot is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The project will also include a justification report and a short video demonstration.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**
- **Report (PDF)**
- **Video Demonstration (2–3 minutes)**

### **Deadline**: 12th May 2025

## Report Structure
- **Introduction**
- **Justification of LLM Choice**
- **Justification of Development Approach**
- **System Design** (optional diagram)
- **Challenges and Lessons Learned**
- **Use of GenAI Tools** (Prompts and Outputs)
- **Conclusion**
- **References** (if applicable)

## Progress So Far
### 1. **Notebook Development**:
- **Jupyter Notebook** (`Untitled.ipynb`) has been created as the primary working file.
- Set up basic structure for the chatbot using LLM (large language model) to answer CTSE lecture-based questions.

### 2. **GenAI Tools**:
- Exploring **python-dotenv** for securely handling API keys.
- Currently planning to implement **Vectara** for vector search-based semantic querying, to enhance chatbot response accuracy. This will allow the chatbot to retrieve contextually relevant information from CTSE lecture notes.

### 3. **Version Control**:
- Repository initialized and committed the initial files:
  - **Jupyter Notebook** with basic setup.
  - **.ipynb_checkpoints** folder for version control (auto-generated by Jupyter).

### 4. **Next Steps**:
- Integrate **LLM** for actual question answering based on CTSE notes.
- Set up **Vectara** API for efficient document retrieval.
- Prepare a report documenting the methodology, the choice of LLM, and integration of GenAI tools.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the **question-answering functionality** using the chosen LLM.
2. Test and finalize the integration with **Vectara**.
3. Complete the report and **video demonstration**.
